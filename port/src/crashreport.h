/*
 * crashreport.h -- a report folder for crashes and freezes.
 *
 * When the game crashes (an unhandled exception) or freezes (nothing new
 * reaches the screen for XBOX_HANG_SECONDS), a folder is written under
 * "CrashReports\" beside the executable (or %LOCALAPPDATA%\SSX Tricky\
 * CrashReports\ when that is not writable) with:
 *
 *   report.txt    what happened, where (module-relative address, guest
 *                 registers), build, Windows version, CPU, GPU, RAM
 *   crash.dmp /   a small minidump: thread list, registers and stack
 *   hang.dmp      pointers only (MiniDumpFilterMemory), module names
 *                 without their folders (MiniDumpFilterModulePaths);
 *                 no game memory, no code, no data segments
 *   log.txt       the last lines the game printed, even with LogFile=0
 *                 (kept in a ring buffer in memory)
 *   settings.txt  the .ini and the XBOX_* variables in effect
 *
 * Folders and the user name are removed from every text file (a path keeps
 * only its file name), and the user name is blanked in the minidump. Nothing
 * is sent anywhere.
 *
 * XBOX_CRASH_REPORT=0 turns all of it off (the previous behaviour exactly).
 * XBOX_HANG_SECONDS=N sets the freeze threshold (default 30, 0 = no watchdog).
 * XBOX_CRASH_TEST=av|div0|stack|hang provokes a crash, or a simulated freeze,
 * XBOX_CRASH_TEST_DELAY seconds (default 20) after the game starts (tests).
 *
 * Cost while playing: none per frame. One thread wakes once a second to read
 * three counters; the ring buffer is static and filled by a thread that only
 * wakes when a 4 KB output buffer is written (a few times a second in a race).
