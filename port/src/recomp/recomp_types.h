/**
 * Xbox Static Recompilation - Runtime Type Definitions
 *
 * Type definitions and helper macros used by mechanically translated
 * x86 -> C code. Each original x86 function is translated to a C
 * function that uses these types and macros.
 *
 * This is a reusable template for ANY Xbox game. Game-specific
 * customization should go in separate headers.
 *
 * Memory model:
 *   Xbox data sections are mapped to their original VAs via
 *   CreateFileMapping + MapViewOfFileEx (see xbox_memory.h).
 *   Recompiled code accesses globals via pointer casts, e.g.:
 *     *(uint32_t*)0x003B2360
 *
 * Register model:
 *   Volatile registers (eax, ecx, edx, esp) are global variables,
 *   matching real x86 behavior where these registers are shared
 *   across all code. This enables correct argument passing via the
 *   simulated stack and return value communication via eax.
 *
 *   Callee-saved registers (ebx, esi, edi) are also global because
 *   callers pass implicit parameters through them (e.g. 'this' via
 *   esi in thiscall). The callee-save contract is enforced by
 *   PUSH32/POP32 instructions in the generated code, not by C local
 *   variable scoping.
 *
 *   ebp is NOT global - it stays local in each function because many
 *   FPO (Frame Pointer Omission) functions use it as scratch without
 *   save/restore. For SEH functions, g_seh_ebp bridges the gap.
 *
 * Calling convention:
 *   All translated functions are void(void). Arguments are passed
 *   on the simulated Xbox stack (via push instructions before call).
 *   Return values are communicated through g_eax.
 *   The call instruction pushes a dummy return address; ret pops it.

 * declared locally inside each function) is fresh and zero-initialized on
 * entry -- there is no cross-function bridge for it, the same gap `ebp` has
 * (see g_seh_ebp above), except nothing plays g_seh_ebp's role for the FPU
 * stack anywhere in this codebase. This matters for `_ftol`-style CRT
 * helpers specifically: on real x86, the value to convert is left on the
 * caller's real x87 register stack (matching the standard MSVC calling
 * convention for these helpers -- no explicit integer argument is pushed),
 * and the callee's `fld st(0)` reads it directly, since the FPU registers
 * are genuine CPU state that persists across the call boundary automatically.
 * In this simulated environment that isn't true: confirmed live that a
 * caller computing a real value (e.g. `fp_top()=33.333332`) results in the
 * callee seeing `fp_top()=0.0` at entry, silently converting from zero
 * instead of the intended value.
 *
 * This is deliberately a narrow, single-purpose bridge for
 * `CRT_ftol_TruncateToInt64` alone -- not a general fix for every function
 * that happens to use the FPU across a call boundary (that would need
 * promoting the entire `_fp_stack`/`_fp_top` pair to `__thread` globals
 * project-wide, a much larger change with real regression risk for
 * functions whose own FPU use is genuinely self-contained per call). Every
 * call site sets this immediately before calling
 * `CRT_ftol_TruncateToInt64()`; the function itself reads it in place of its
