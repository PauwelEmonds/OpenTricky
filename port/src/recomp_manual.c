/**
 * Manual function overrides and ICALL diagnostics
 *
 * This file provides:
 *   - recomp_lookup_manual()  : intercept specific Xbox VAs with hand-written code
 *   - recomp_icall_fail_log() : log when an indirect call target can't be resolved
 *   - ICALL trace ring buffer  : globals used by the RECOMP_ICALL macro
 *
 * The recomp pipeline generates an auto-dispatch table (recomp_lookup) that
 * resolves most function addresses. recomp_lookup_manual() is called FIRST,
 * giving you a chance to override any function with a custom implementation.
 *
 * Common reasons to add manual overrides:
 *   - Trace a function to understand call flow (wrap the generated version)
 *   - Fix a function the lifter translated incorrectly
 *   - Stub out a function that crashes (return early, set eax to a safe value)
 *   - Redirect a function to a native implementation (e.g., skip CRT init)
 *   - Intercept D3D/audio calls for custom rendering or sound

/* ── Video framebuffer discovery ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The title's video player does not draw through the push buffer: it locks the
 * back buffer through the Xbox D3D8 linked into the XBE and writes decoded MPEG
 * pixels straight into guest video memory. Nothing then moved those pixels to
 * the host swap chain, so the intro video decoded perfectly and the screen
 * stayed black.
 *
 * The addresses were found by hand once (0xF3BA0000 / 0xF3CCC000, double
 * buffered) and lived in XBOX_GUEST_FB / XBOX_GUEST_FB2. Hardcoding them is not
 * a fix -- they are a property of one build's VRAM layout. This wraps the guest
 * LockRect instead and takes the surface the title itself hands back, so the
 * video works with nothing set.
 *
 * sub_0016B1C0(surface, pLockedRect, pRect, flags), ret 16. On entry esp points
 * at the dummy return address, so pLockedRect is at [esp+8], and it must be
 * read BEFORE the call -- the original pops its arguments.
 *
 * Only surfaces in the write-combined VRAM alias with a sane 32-bit pitch are
 * taken; this call also serves plenty of surfaces that are not the framebuffer.
