"""Fork pass: bounded walk of the rider lists in sub_0002F800 (rank catch-up).

Every 6 ticks of a race, sub_0002F800(race) sorts the riders and splits them on
rider+0x44C (1 = human Player, 0 = AI) into two lists on its stack frame:

    esp+0xCC  Player list (4 slots)      esp+0xDC  AI list (6 slots)

then walks the AI list up to [race+0x80] (the AI count fixed when the race was
built, 5 in a 1-player race) and, for each AI, takes its target from the
Player list (pointer [esp+0x38], from esp+0xCC, one slot per [race+0x88] /
[race+0x7C] AIs), without checking how many entries either list holds:

    0x0002FD50  mov edx, [esp+ebx*4+0xDC]       ; AI list slot ebx
                mov ecx, [edi+edx*4+0xC4]       ; race->rider[edx]
                mov eax, [esp+0x38]
                mov eax, [eax]                  ; Player list slot
                mov esi, [edi+eax*4+0xC4]       ; race->rider[eax]
                mov [ecx+0x130], eax            ; AI target = that index

If, at that call, the flags disagree with the counts the race was built with,
the walk reads a slot it never wrote: leftover stack bytes (0x3F800000 in the
crash seen on the AI side), so the rider index is ~1e9 and the read lands
far from the race object: access violation (one Garibaldi run), or, with the RAM mirrors
mapped, a wild read and a wrong target. AI side: fewer riders with flag 0 than
[race+0x80] (seen once). Player side: fewer riders with flag 1 than
[race+0x7C] (never seen). The original code has the same unchecked
walk; why the counts disagreed in that run is not known.

With the runtime switch g_fix_riderlist (XBOX_FIX_RIDERLIST, default 1,
port/src/main.c), this pass:
  1. fills the 6 AI-list and the 4 Player-list slots with 0xFFFFFFFF before the
     split (0x0002FB83), so an unwritten slot is recognisable instead of being
     stack garbage;
  2. after the split (0x0002FBC5) stores how many entries each list received
     (g_riderlist_ai_n / g_riderlist_pl_n) and, if they differ from
     [race+0x80] / [race+0x7C], reports it (fork_riderlist_note, kind 0);
  3. at the top of the walk body (0x0002FD50, before any x87 push), leaves
     through the function's own epilogue (loc_0002FFA0) when the AI slot or the
     Player slot does not hold a valid rider index (>= [race+0x88]), and reports
     it (kind 1 = AI side, 2 = Player side).
fork_riderlist_note (main.c) writes one "[RIDERLIST] ..." line on stderr per
kind and per race, so a long test run sees it in the log.
When the counts agree (every run measured) nothing changes: the slots filled
are all overwritten before they are read, no report is made.
0 = the original code (no fill, no count, no guard, no report).
