/**
 * Xbox Memory Layout Compatibility
 *
 * The Xbox has 64MB of unified memory shared between CPU and GPU.
 * Memory is identity-mapped (physical == virtual for most of it).
 * Game code and data are linked to specific address ranges which vary
 * per game. Section addresses are parsed dynamically from the XBE header
 * at runtime, so this module works with ANY Xbox game.
 *
 * On Windows, we:
 * 1. Create a 64MB file mapping (CreateFileMapping)
 * 2. Map the base view + 28 mirror views at 64MB intervals
 * 3. Parse the XBE section table and copy sections to their Xbox VAs
 * 4. Set up simulated stack, heap, TIB, and kernel data area
 *
 * The mirror views ensure Xbox RAM wrapping works correctly: the Xbox
 * memory controller uses a 26-bit address bus, so ALL addresses wrap
 * modulo 64MB. File mapping views backed by the same section give us
 * true aliases where writes at one address are visible at all mirrors.

 * single fake TIB at Xbox VA 0, shared by every guest thread -- but on

 *              shared slot, threads splice each other's frames into one
 *              chain that then walks across foreign stacks.
 *   fs:[0x28]  Per-thread TLS block. The CRT stores a heap pointer here
 *              per thread; sharing it meant one thread read another's
 *              value, and a torn read sent _threadstartex into a ~4 GB
 *              memcpy from Xbox VA 4.
 *
 * Each guest thread now gets its own 0x100-byte TIB out of this pool, and
 * xbox_resolve_uncached_alias (recomp_types.h) redirects any access below
 * 0x100 to the calling thread's own block. One predictable compare on the
