/*
 * PFIFO "kick and spin" pump.
 *
 * The D3D driver's low-level command-pusher code spins waiting for a real
 * PFIFO command processor to do its job -- one that doesn't exist here
 * (PFIFO is an acknowledged, deliberately unfinished "Phase 1" stub in
 * this tool). Confirmed live via gdb
 * across two distinct spin shapes so far, both hanging off the same GPU
 * channel-context global at Xbox VA 0x1776C0:
 *
 *   1. Two near-identical leaf functions ("kick the pusher") set bit
 *      0x10000 at a fixed hardware register, Xbox VA 0xFD100410, then
 *      spin reading it until real hardware would clear it.
 *   2. A "wait for ring-buffer space" loop compares a PUT value (a plain
 *      field in the context struct, +0x1C) against a GET value read
 *      through a pointer stored at +0x3F0 -- itself a Xbox-heap-allocated
 *      software bookkeeping cell, not hardware, and nothing ever advances
 *      it because there's no real consumer draining the ring.
 *   3. A "wait for GPU fence" loop: the driver increments a target fence
 *      value (context+0x10) and pushes a "set fence" command, then polls
 *      a completion readback -- a pointer to a small status struct at
 *      context+0x2304, whose +0x44 field is where real hardware would
 *      write the fence it has actually reached -- until it matches.
 *      Confirmed the context here is the very same one: the caller passes
 *      the literal constant 0x174B30, which is exactly what gets stored
 *      at Xbox VA 0x1776C0 during device init (see sub_0016B0E0).
 *   4. A per-frame "don't get more than 2 frames ahead of the GPU" throttle
 *      (sub_001688D0): compares a producer count (context+0x2B60, bumped
 *      once per frame submitted) against a consumer count (context+0x2518,
 *      what real hardware would advance as it finishes each frame) and
 *      spins (via a plain ~400-cycle busy-wait stall, sub_0016B210) while
 *      producer-consumer >= 2. Confirmed live via gdb: the main thread
 *      hangs here indefinitely the first time `Application_RunMainLoop`
 *      reaches real rendering (`SceneRenderer_RenderFrame`) -- the frame
 *      counter above +0x2518 never advances because, same as every other
 *      wait here, there's no real GPU behind it counting anything.
 *
 * All three are the same underlying gap wearing different clothes: no
 * command ever actually gets consumed or completed. Modeling "the software
 * GPU processes everything instantly" fixes all three at once -- clear the
 * kick bit, make GET track PUT, and make the fence readback track the
 * fence target, every tick, so any wait built on them resolves within one
 * poll interval.
 *
 * Fixing this at the generated-code call sites would work today but
 * silently stop working the moment this codebase gets regenerated from a
 * fresh seed round (a real, recurring event in this project) or a new call
 * site appears in code a future round translates. Fixing it here instead
 * -- by walking the same context chain the driver itself resolves, not by
 * patching any particular caller -- survives both. This thread only ever
 * touches plain Xbox memory cells (never any of the shared g_eax/g_ebx/
 * g_esi/g_edi/g_esp CPU-register globals, and never calls into any
 * recompiled register-based code), so it's safe to run concurrently with
 * the single synchronous Xbox "thread" the rest of this runtime assumes --
 * there's nothing here to race with it.
