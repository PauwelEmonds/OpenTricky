/*
 * d3d8_gpuprof.h -- GPU time per pass of a frame.
 *
 *   XBOX_GPUPROF=1             [GPU] summary every 2 s on stderr + report at exit
 *   XBOX_GPUPROF_CSV=<path>    also, one line per frame
 *
 * Each draw, clear and post step is bracketed by two timestamp queries,
 * issued back to back with no CPU work in between: their gap is the GPU
 * execution time of that work alone, even when the GPU waits for the CPU
 * between two draws (which the "GPU" measure of XBOX_PERF, Present to
 * Present, does count). Gaps are summed per category; "span" = from the
 * first to the last timestamp of the frame (busy time + gaps). Read back
 * without waiting, NF frames later.
 *
 * Inert by default: without XBOX_GPUPROF, g_gpuprof_on is 0 and each
 * measurement point comes down to a test of that variable. Pump thread only.
 * Notable CPU cost when active (~2 queries per draw): do not measure FPS
 * with it.
